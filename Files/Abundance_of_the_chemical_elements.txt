The abundance of the chemical elements is a measure of the occurrence of the
chemical elements relative to all other elements in a given environment.
Abundance is measured in one of three ways: by the mass-fraction (the same as
weight fraction); by the mole-fraction (fraction of atoms by numerical count,
or sometimes fraction of molecules in gases); or by the volume-fraction.
Volume-fraction is a common abundance measure in mixed gases such as planetary
atmospheres, and is similar in value to molecular mole-fraction for gas
mixtures at relatively low densities and pressures, and ideal gas mixtures.
Most abundance values in this article are given as mass-fractions.
